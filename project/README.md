#### Description:
This precisely prepared project's main goal is to give investors a trustworthy and useful tool that will allow them to obtain real-time stock market data. In today's fast-paced financial environment, having access to timely and accurate information is essential for making wise and smart investment decisions. In the 'project.py' file, we have harnessed the might of two essential Python libraries, 'bs4' and'requests,' enabling us to effectively gather and extract relevant data from the wide expanse of the internet.

The core of our project is the data collection method. We have successfully put together a complete dataset using web scraping methods, which is a priceless resource for investors. This dataset includes a variety of stock-related data, such as current prices, historical information, market patterns, and more. Our idea gives investors the critical knowledge required to successfully traverse the complicated and dynamic world of financial markets by giving them access to such a plethora of data.

We have included a vital function, suitably titled "percent_change," into our code to further increase the usability of this data. The quantification of stock price movements depends critically on this function. It enables investors to properly determine and evaluate how much the value of a stock has risen or fallen over predetermined time periods. This function is crucial for assisting investors in evaluating the performance of their holdings and making prompt decisions based on factual information.

Our project's reliability and accuracy have been of utmost importance. To do this, we've put in place a thorough testing tool that examines each of the 'test_project.py' file's routines. This extensive testing program ensures that our product continually performs at its highest level, giving users reliable results. Our dedication to quality control distinguishes us from the competition and inspires trust in our tool's users.
In addition to functionality, we also took the user experience into account. By providing them in the'requirements.txt' file, we have made it easy for users to get the required libraries. By streamlining the installation procedure, this intelligent feature makes it possible for users to easily set up their environments and start using our application. This strategy is in line with our dedication to making information accessible to everyone and makes sure that consumers can quickly start their data-driven investing journeys.

In conclusion, our carefully thought-out initiative is a committed attempt to provide investors with the fundamental skills they require to succeed in the constantly changing world of finance. We provide accurate estimations of stock price fluctuations, thorough testing for dependability, and real-time data on the stock market. Our simplified installation procedures also improve user accessibility. Access to reliable and current information is essential for making well-informed investment decisions as the financial markets continue to change. Our initiative serves as a useful, approachable tool that closes this knowledge gap and gives investors the tools they need to succeed.
